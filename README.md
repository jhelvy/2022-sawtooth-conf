**Title**

Tools for Designing and Testing Choice-Based Conjoint Surveys in R

**Description**

This talk introduces the [{cbcTools}](https://github.com/jhelvy/cbcTools) R package, which provides researchers tools for assessing experiment designs and sample size requirements under a variety of different conditions prior to fielding an experiment. The package contains functions for generating experiment designs and surveys as well as functions for simulating choice data and estimating user-defined models on different subsets of the simulated data to inform sample size requirements, including using designs exported from Sawtooth Software.
